These coordinates are meant to be used in Mennyoo. Sadly, currently there isn't an easier way to spawn props in SP. 

- Open the Mennyoo menu, and navigate to "Object Spooner" - "Spawn Entity Into World" - "Object" - "Search"
- Type in " prop_idol_case_01 " (it is ideal to save the prop as your favorite so you don't have to search for it everytime)
- Go back to the "Object Spooner" tab, select "Manage Entities" and then select the prop you spawned. 
- Scroll to the bottom, and select "Attachment Options". 
- Select "Attach to Something" and then "Self".
- Set the settings and coordinates to the supplied ones below:
