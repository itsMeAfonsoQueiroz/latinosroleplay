What is a YBN file?
AeronModding answers you!

A YBN file in GTA 5, also known as "YuMeYuMe's Collision File Format," is a crucial component for mapping and creating environments in the game. 
It's a file type used to define the collisions and physical boundaries of objects and structures within the virtual world of Grand Theft Auto.
This specific file, the YBN, contains geometric data that outlines the shapes and physical properties of objects, buildings, roads, and other elements within the game world. 
It defines areas where characters can move, where vehicles can travel or stop, as well as areas that can be traversed or are restricted.
In the context of mapping for a training center, using YBN files is essential to accurately model virtual spaces that represent the real environment. 
By correctly defining collisions, dimensions, and boundaries, trainers can create realistic simulations for learning and training in various fields such as driving, safety, logistics, or other specific sectors.
These YBN files are created using specific modeling and creation tools, then integrated into the game to enable an immersive and authentic experience. 
By precisely adjusting object collisions and physical interactions, trainers can provide accurate and useful virtual environments for learning and practice.
In summary, YBN files are a fundamental element for creating virtual environments in GTA 5, allowing trainers to design interactive and realistic spaces for effective and immersive training in various professional fields.
